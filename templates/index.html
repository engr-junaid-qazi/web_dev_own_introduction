        <p> My name is <b>Engr. Junaid Jahangir Qazi.</b> By profession, i am an
            <b>Electronics Engineer. </b> I am currently employed at Indus
            University Karachi as a <b> "Lecturer" </b>, in the
            department of <b>Electrical & Electronics Engineering </b>.
        
            I am a versatile person having diverse capabilities to work
            in a challenging environment.
       </p>

        <p> I am an Electronics Engineer, graduated from Dawood University of
            Engineering & Technology in 2012. Since then, i have done many jobs
            in different fields. 

            As the world is changing rapidly, so every field is getting new
            diemensions. This also happened with the engineering field also.
            So, i have decided to take the advantage of this. Luckily i have
            got admission in Saylani Welfare International Trust's renowned and
            recognized Artificial Intelligence and Data Science course. Our
            teachers at Saylani are well renowned and master of their trades.
            They have given and teach me everything from the microscopic level
            to macroscopic level. Alongwith Saylani internal on-site classes,
            i have been awarded DataCamp subscription to do various Data Science
            online courses to make myself feeling a true Data Scientist.
            
            Moreover, i have keen interest in programming from the beginning of
            my career and i have adopted it as my hobby. But through this
            course, now i am in a position to make this field as my future
            career because it has tremendous potential of progress. 
            My expertise includes:
            <p><ul><li> Python Programming </li>
                <li> Python Programming for Data Science & Data Analytics </li>
                <li> Data Visualization </li>
                <li> Web & Data Scraping & Extraction </li>
                <li> HTML, CSS, JS, Flask </li>
